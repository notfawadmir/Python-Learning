Conditional Operators: <, >, >=, <=, ==, !=
:::Whats the difference between if and switch statement 
STATEMENTs: Use for decision making.
IFELSE::::::
Age = int(input("Enter Your age: "))	#You can take input as float also.
print("Your age is: ", Age)
print(Age==18)	#Equality
print(Age>18)
print(Age<18)
print(Age>=18)
print(Age<=18)
print(Age!=18)	#Not equal Sign
if(Age>18):
    print("You are eligible to drive:")	#The space shows you 
#that you are inside the "if" loop    
else:
    print("You are not eligible to drive: ")
print("Yay!!!!")	#this is not inside the Else loop.


ELIF::::::
N = int(input("Enter the value: "))
if(N<0):
    print("The Number is Negative")
elif(N==0):
    print("The Number is Zero")
elif(N!=0):
    print("The Number is not equal to Zero")
elif(N>0):
    print("The Number is greater than zero")
elif(N<=0):
    print("The Number is less or equal to zero")
else:
    print("The Number is greater or equal to zero")


NESTED LOOP::::
num = float(input("The Number enter by the user: "))
if(num<0):
    print("Number is Negative")
elif(num>0):			#Nesting is started here
    if(num<=10):
        print("The number is between 1 and 10")
    elif(num>10 and num<=11):
         print("The number is between 10 and 11")
    elif(num>10  and num<=20):
        print("The Number is between 11 and 20")
    else:
         print("Number is greater than 20")	#Nest ending here
else:
    print("Number is zero")


NESTED Statements:
num = int(input("Enter the Value: "))
if (num<0):
    print("The value is less than zero")
elif(num>0):
    print("The Number is Greater than zero")
    if(num<=10):
        print("The Number is less or equal to 10")
    elif(num>10 or num<=11):
        print("The Number is in between 10 and 11")
    elif(num>10 and num<=20):
        print("The number is in between 10 and 21")
    else:
        print("the number is greater than 20")
else:
    print("The Number is equal to zero")
