Today's class 

shortcut for code running: f3 in settings
theme chosen: monokai
first program hello world
print("Hello world", 6, 7, 8): We can print multiple values in output.
print("Hello WOrld", 6, 7, sep = '~'): It will seprate the character by the sign ~ in output.

and some features of print command
new line: \n
comments: # used for comment. you can add multiple comments using this sign. 
this is non executable line.

can also select the code and press Ctrl + /: thw whole line will auto commented.
multi-line comment: Select the lines and press Ctrl+/
also used triple single quotes or triple double quotes for commenting multiple lines.

Escape sequnce character: \n it look like two characters but actually it is one charater which is 
used for new line.

variables and data types: VARIABLE: its a container that holds data.
a=1
print(a):::: in my computer 1 is stored in the place of "a" in RAM.
a=1		::Value
b=True		::Boolean
c="Harry"	::String
d= None		::None type varaible

DATA TYPE: It specify the type of varaible that holds by the varaible.
for operations the same data type should be there.
in order to know the type of the data type we use TYPE function.
print("The type of a is: ", Type(a))
a = 1
b = "Rizwan"
c = True
d = None
e = 1.56
f = complex(5,8)
g = [1,1.24,"Horse", [1,2], [1.4, 0.6]]
h = ("Parrot", "line")
i = {"Name":"MRK", "Age": 25, "Can Vote": True }
print(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i)
print("Type of vraibles are: " , type(a))
print("Type of vraibles are: " , type(b))
print("Type of vraibles are: " , type(c))
print("Type of vraibles are: " , type(d))
print("Type of vraibles are: " , type(e))
print("Type of vraibles are: " , type(f))
print("Type of vraibles are: " , type(g))
print("Type of vraibles are: " , type(h))
print("Type of vraibles are: " , type(i))

Task: Add two complex numbers.
Built-in Data Types:
Number: int, float, complex
a = 1		: Int
b = 1.56	: FLoat
c= complex(3,5)	:COmplex

LIST: Order collection of different data elements of vary data types.: Will learn in future.
Tuples: Tuple is exactly the same as lists but not changeable means immutable: also learn in future.
Mapped data: DICtionary::Collection of key value pairs.

In python everything is object.

Exercise: Create a Calculator in JUPYTER NOTEBOOK: which perform the following operations
addition of two numbers
subtraction of two numbers
power of value upto any number.
division of two numbers
multiplication of two numbers.
But the conditions are:
1. input should be taken from the user.
2. Hint: 5**6
